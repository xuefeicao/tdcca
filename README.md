# Time-dependent Canonical Correlation Analysis 
Canonical Correlation Analysis is a technique in multivariate data analysis for finding correlation and pairs of vectors that maximizes the correlation between a set of paired variables. Many important problems involve recoding time-dependent observations. In order to understand the coupling dynamics between the two sources, spot trends, detect anomalies, in this paper, we introduce the time-dependent canonical correlation analysis (TDCCA), a method of inferring time-dependent canonical vectors of paired variables.  


## Getting Started
We provide both simulation examples used in our paper. The main computation algorithm is not added into the class method for the convinience of algorithm development for multi-view data. The package saves all the analysis to the given folder and saves the prepocessed data into the hdf5 file. The parallel computing with multi-cores is also allowed and tested in Linux system. This package also provides other algorithms to optimize the function, including cvxpy naive optimization, cvxpy naive admm optimization and two other admm algorithms. For details, see the admm_computation.py file. However, these functions have not been tested thoroughly. 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

This package is also published in pypi. For a quick installation, try

```
pip install tdcca 
```

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
See setup.py for details of packages requirements. 
```

### Installing from GitHub


Download the packages by using git clone https://github.com/xuefeicao/tdcca.git

### Intro to our package
After installing our package locally, try to import tdcca in your python environment and learn about package's function. 
Note: our package name in pypi is tdcca.
```
from tdcca import *
help(multi_sim)
```
